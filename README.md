## Diversity - Hiring ## 
**Diversity & Inclusion  - Diversity asks, “Who do we bring into our organization?” Inclusion asks, “How do we make them feel welcome when they get here?”!**

## Layers of Diversity - The Four Layers of Diversity - Gardenswartz and Rowe 
- **Personality**  - Unique to each individual—style and characteristics, preferences, perceptions, behavioral predispositions, cognitive and learning styles—influenced by, outer layers.
- **Internal dimensions** – Aspects assigned at birth, have little control, gender, sexual orientation, physical abilities, ethnicity, race, and age.
- **External dimensions** - Life experiences and choices, geographic location, income, personal habits, recreational habits, religion, education, work experiences, appearance, marital status, and parental status.
- **Organizational dimensions** - Similarities and differences individual’s position in the organization. functional level or classification; content or field of work; division, department, unit, or group; seniority; work location; union affiliation; and management status.

## Four dynamics work against organizational inclusiveness ##
- **Covering** - out group employees, try to conform.
- **Prototypes for success** -  a “similarity bias”  tends to reward with assignments, promotions, etc. who share the same traits as management.
- **Bias-based exclusion** -  discriminatory treatment of minority employees.
- **Majority backlash** -  majority feeling excluded from the benefits of diversity initiatives.


## Covering ## 
**Occurs when an organization recruits a diverse workforce but, promotes assimilation rather than inclusion.** Covering four dimensions:  <br />
- **Appearance** - Adjusting their attire, grooming, and mannerisms to “blend in.”
- **Affiliation** - Avoiding behaviors associated with their “identity group” (culture, ethnic minority, sexual orientation).
- **Advocacy** - Avoiding engaging in advocacy on behalf of their identity group.
- **Association** - Avoiding associating with members of their identity group.
